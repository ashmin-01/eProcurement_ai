The particular molecular configuration of Sika® ViscoCrete® ACE 575 accelerates the cement hydration by exposing increased surface of the cement grains to react with water. As a result, it is possible to obtain earlier development of the heat of hydration, rapid development of the hydration products and, as a consequence, higher strengths at very early age. The polymer structure of Sika® ViscoCrete® ACE 575 is specially designed to improve the rheology of precast concrete, making it very flowable and low viscous even at very low water/cement ratio without increasing stickiness. Robustness is a distinctive feature of the precast concrete produced with Sika® ViscoCrete® ACE 575. Suitable for use in hot and tropical climatic conditions. ZERO ENERGY SYSTEM Zero Energy System is based on a combination of the latest Sika® ViscoCrete® superplasticizers and advanced self-compacting concrete technology.

It has been primarily developed for applications in the ready mixed and precast concrete industries where the highest durability and performance is required. CHEMISTRY & MECHANISM OF ACTION Conventional superplasticisers, such as those based on sulphonated melamine and naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, at the time of mixing, become absorbed onto the surface of the cement particles. This absorption takes place at a very early stage in the hydration process. The sulphonic groups of the polymer chains increase the negative charge on the surface of the cement particle and dispersion of the cement occurs by electrostatic repulsion. Sika® ViscoCrete® GL 3165 is differentiated from conventional superplasticisers in that it is based on a unique carboxylic ether polymer with long lateral chains. This greatly improves cement dispersion. At the start of the mixing process the same electrostatic dispersion occurs as described previously but the presence of the lateral chains, linked to the polymer backbone, generate a steric hindrance which stabilises the cement particles capacity to separate and disperse. This mechanism provides flowable concrete with greatly reduced water demand.

As a result, it is possible to obtain earlier development of the heat of hydration, rapid development of the hydration products and, as a result, higher strengths achievement at very early age. The polymer structure of Sika® ViscoCrete® ACE 507 M is specially designed to improve the rheology of precast concrete, making it very flowable and low viscous even at very low water/cement ratio, without increasing stickiness.
